I am currently pursuing an [Erasmus Mundus Joint master's Degree in Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA)](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/) , coordinated by the University of Girona, Spain, along with the Université de Bourgogne, France, and the University of Cassino, Italy as partner universities.

My research interest includes Signal Processing, Medical Imaging, Image Processing, Machine Learning & Applied Artificial Intelligence.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology](https://www.aust.edu/)  , Dhaka, Bangladesh. My B.Sc. thesis was on Pattern Recognition system for the development of Raspberry Pi based speaker recognizer.

I worked as a Lecturer at the [Department of Electrical & Electronic Engineering](https://www.aust.edu/eee/faculty_member/mr_faisal_farhan) at Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology and currently on a study leave.
