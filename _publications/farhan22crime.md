abstract: "Crime trend analysis has become a mandatory task as the scale of crime is increasing rapidly all over the globe. In recent years, Bangladesh has encountered various types of crimes and the rate is increasing with its increased population. Both physical and digital based crimes have become very common and their fatality can disrupt the advancement of any country. To tackle the situation, it is important to investigate and forecast the crime patterns that can assist the law enforcement agencies for easier investigation. Machine Learning and Deep Learning based crime analysis has become very popular as they can accurately and efficiently analyze large criminal dataset. In this study, the authors implemented machine learning techniques as well as ANN architecture to assess and forecast crime trends in Bangladesh. The dataset in this experiment was collected from the Bangladesh Police website that consists of criminal records of various crimes during the years 2010 to 2019. Authors evaluated the performance of ANN with other regression models named linear Regression and Support Vector Regression for crime prediction. The proposed model(ANN) outperforms other two models in this study compared to all the performance evaluation metrics. Hence ANN model is suggested by the authors to forecast and analyze future crime trends."
