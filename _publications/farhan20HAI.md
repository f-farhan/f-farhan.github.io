abstract: "Human activity identification (HAI) is presently a promising field for artificial intelligence researchers. HAI can be applied in various areas in our daily life such as surveillance, health care, etc. There are several machine learning and deep learning techniques that are applied to recognize the human activity. Various multi-dimensional sensors from smartphones, smart tablets, smartwatches can record different types of human activity. Some extensive sensors in smartphones such as accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, GPS, and camera which can respond to record human gestures. These gestures can be sitting, lying, standing, walking, etc. In this study, the authors analyze the performance of traditional machine learning techniques as well as 1D-CNN architecture to recognize human activity using the UCI human activity identification dataset. PCA has been enforced to reduce the dimension and feature selection to get better results. 1D-CNN performs better in this study with an accuracy of 97.30%. Where Logistic regression achieves 96.00%, Linear Support Vector Machine achieves 93.71%, Kernel-Support Vector Machine achieves 94.85%, Random Forest achieves 90.59% and Decision Tree achieves 84.46% accuracy. All the accuracies are considered by taking the average of individual class accuracy. However, the 1D-CNN model is proposed by the authors to implement in less computational powered devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc."
